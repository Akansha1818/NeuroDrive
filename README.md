## 📖 Project Description

The Brain Controlled Wheelchair project demonstrates a system where electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are processed and interpreted in real time to steer a simulated wheelchair. This solution integrates signal processing, machine learning, and web technologies to provide a proof-of-concept for assistive mobility devices controlled directly by brain activity.

Key objectives:
- Capture and preprocess EEG signals from an open-source dataset.
- Extract meaningful features (FFT components, kurtosis, skewness) for classification.
- Train and compare multiple machine learning models (ANN, Random Forest, SVM).
- Deploy a RESTful API to serve predictions.
- Build a frontend simulation for user interaction with the wheelchair.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js (React)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Simulation:** Canvas-based wheelchair animation
- **State management:** React Context API / Hooks

### Backend
- **Web API:** Python Flask
- **Data processing & visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Signal analysis:** SciPy (FFT, kurtosis, skewness)
- **Deep learning & ML:** TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

We explored and fine‑tuned the following classifiers:
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** Multi-layer perceptron with dropout layers and batch normalization for regularization and stable training.
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble of decision trees for robust, non-linear classification.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Kernel-based classifier for high-dimensional feature separation.

Model features:
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- Batch normalization for faster convergence.
- Comparison of accuracy and inference speed to select the best model for real‑time control.

## 📊 Dataset

We used EEG recordings from the [Wheel Chair EEG Signals dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mneebahmd/wheel-chair-eeg-signals).

## ✨ Project Features

- **Real-time EEG preprocessing:** Bandpass filtering and artifact removal.
- **Feature extraction:** FFT coefficients, kurtosis, skewness.
- **Model training & evaluation:** Automated pipeline for cross-validation and hyperparameter search.
- **Flask REST API:** `/predict` endpoint to serve live classification results.
- **Interactive frontend:** Users can visualize wheelchair movements driven by EEG predictions.
- **Simulation export:** Package simulation into a standalone executable via PyInstaller.

## 🎯 Learning & Goals

- Understand EEG signal characteristics and preprocessing techniques.
- Compare classical ML models with deep learning approaches for biosignal classification.
